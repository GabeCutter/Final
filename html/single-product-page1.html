                            <br>Few bands loom larger in the collective memory of the '90s than Hootie & the Blowfish, the unforgettably-named roots rockers behind decade classics like "Only Wanna Be with You" and "Time." Combining heartland rock and pop sensibility, the band's 1994 debut album Cracked Rear View went 16 times platinum, landing five singles on the charts and becoming the top-selling album of 1995. In 2014, the band will reunite on stage to celebrate 20 years since their landmark debut, treating fans at select tour dates to their greatest hits as well as new material from their highly anticipated reunion album.
                        
                            <br><br>BACKGROUND SNAPSHOT:
                        
                            <br>Formed by four University of South Carolina freshmen in 1986, Hootie & the Blowfish released several demo EPs before launching to superstardom with their  chart-topping 1994 debut Cracked Rear View. Singer Darius Rucker's iconic baritone became an ubiquitous presence on '90s airwaves as songs like "Let Her Cry" and "Hold My Hand" climbed the charts, eventually making the debut the top-selling album of 1995. After picking up Best New Artist at the 1996 Grammys, the quartet once again landed at No. 1 with sophomore album Fairweather Johnson,  appearing on MTV Unplugged in support of the album's release. Following the 2005 release of Looking for Lucky, the group disbanded, announcing reunion shows in 2014 to the delight of fans around the world.

                            <br>"This show was unforgettable. The band still plays with chemistry like they were still touring. They are so energetic and still sound amazing. They came out for two encores. I highly recommend this show!"
                        
                            <br>"Stage set was amazing and the Band was outstanding. Great sound and the set list was perfect. They covered a few songs like Cheap Tricks 'Surrender' (AMAZING), Doobie Brothers, and more, along with All the Blowfish's greats!"
                        
                            <br>"It was like the 90's all over again! You have got to love a band that has fun playing music."
